The Transition object is used to store transitions involving the environment and agent states.

It stores information in key-value pairs and allows filtering and retrieving information
based on their keys.

class Transition:
    """Stores information like observations and actions gathered from experience.

    This class is used to store a transition, which includes observations, actions, and other related data
    collected during the interaction between the agent and environment.

    Attributes:
        _data (dict): A dictionary that stores the data of the transition in key-value pairs. The values
                      can be either numpy arrays or torch tensors.

    Methods:
        __init__(**kwargs): Initializes the transition object with the given data.
        combine(transitions): Combines a batch of transitions into a single transition object.
        filter(*keys): Filters the transition object to include the specified keys.
        keys(): Returns a list of all the keys in the transition object.
        __add__(other): Adds the data of two transition objects, combining them.
        __getitem__(keys): Retrieves the data stored in the transition object by key(s).
        __repr__(): Returns a string representation of the transition object.
